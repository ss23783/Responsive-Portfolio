      <p>I enjoy the simple things in life. I've been through more than most people my age, but hey it's what made me stronger. Life has thrown me many challenges and so far, I've come out on top. Fitness is a passion of mine. I love house music and football. Power and Breaking Bad are my two favorite TV shows. I'm average, and that's okay. I'm not one of those guys that you turn your head toward when I walk downthe street, and that's fine too. There is more to life then just looks. It's all about your heart. That's what really counts.</p>
